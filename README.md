## Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This game allows two players to play a game of Tic Tac Toe over the internet.

To start a game, one player must visit the website and click the "Join Game" button. This will create a new game and the
player will become player 1. The game will then be waiting for another player to join.

Player 2 can then visit the website and click the "Join Game" button. This will cause the game to start, with player 1
going first.

The players take turns making moves by clicking on an empty square on the game board. The first player to get 3 of their
symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares are filled and no player
has won, the game is a draw.

Players can leave the game at any time by clicking the "Leave Game" button. This will cause the game to end and the
other player to win.

The game state is displayed at the top of the page, including whose turn it is and the current winner (if any).

Thank you for playing Tic Tac Toe!
